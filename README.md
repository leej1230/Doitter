# DoItter
## Find Inspiration in Everyday Successes
## Inspiration
Sometimes we need a reminder to celebrate our small successes in life.  
Although social media is often used to glamorize our long-term goals, it's even more important to enjoy life every small step of the way.
## What it does
DoItter allows users to share their To-Do lists and celebrate checking-off tasks along with your friends. Simply login with your Google account, add some items that you want to track, then share! You can see your friends' to-do lists in a Twitter-like feed.

## How we built it
First, we brainstormed ideas and drew rough design diagrams for our end-product.  
Then, we split the tasks up into steps and organized them on a Trello board.  
For the Front-End we utilized React Next.js and the Material UI Framework.

## What's next for Doitter
We want to add optional tags that can be added to To-Do items. Tags will be re-used so that users can keep track of their accomplishments.  
For example, a 'Gym' or 'Exercise' tag could be added to To-Do items. On your profile page, you could then see how many times you have successfully checked-off exercise!
